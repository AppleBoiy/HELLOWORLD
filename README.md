# HELLOWORLD

The ***HELLOWORLD*** project embodies a comprehensive collection of Hello, World! programs scripted in diverse programming languages. The primary objective of this initiative is to furnish learners with elementary programs that serve as foundational building blocks for comprehending various programming paradigms.

## What is "Hello, World!"?

A "Hello, World!" program epitomizes a fundamental computer program that typically produces a simple output, often the message "Hello, World!", displayed on the screen or console. It serves as an introductory exercise in programming, allowing novices to grasp basic syntax and program structure.

## Acknowledgements

The iconic image of the `"Hello, World!"` program printed in the C programming language, created by [Brian Kernighan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan), serves as an enduring symbol of programming enlightenment. The project acknowledges and appreciates the contribution of this seminal work to the realm of computer science and programming education.
